                            Shopify was founded in 2004 by Tobias Lütke and Scott Lake after attempting to open
                            Snowdevil, an online store for snowboarding equipment. Dissatisfied with the existing
                            e-commerce products on the market, Lütke, a computer programmer by trade, instead built his
                            own.[11][12][13] Lütke used the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails to build
                            Snowdevil's online store, and launched it after two months of development.[14][15] The
                            Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.[14]

                            In June 2009, Shopify launched an application programming interface (API) platform and App
                            Store. The API allows developers to create applications for Shopify online stores and then
                            sell them on the Shopify App Store.[16]

                            In April 2010, Shopify launched a free mobile app on the Apple App Store. The app lets
                            Shopify store owners view and manage their stores from iOS mobile devices.[17] In 2010,
                            Shopify started its Build-A-Business competition, in which participants create a business
                            using its commerce platform.[18][19] The winners of the competition receive cash prizes and
                            mentor-ship from entrepreneurs, such as Richard Branson, Eric Ries and others.[19] Shopify
                            was named Ottawa's Fastest Growing Company by the Ottawa Business Journal in 2010.[14] The
                            company received $7 million from an initial series A round of venture capital financing in
                            December 2010.[20][21] Its Series B round raised $15 million in October 2011.[22]

                            We believe that buying glasses should be easy and fun. It should leave you happy and
                            good-looking, with money in your pocket. We also believe that everyone has the right to see.

                            Warby Parker’s mission statement reminds us of why it was founded and then reveals its aims
                            for a better future.

                            Note their core business aim: “Offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price.”

                            In the vision statement, they address the core problems consumers face when purchasing
                            glasses: It can be annoying, boring, costly, and still leave you anxious about whether or
                            not they look good.

                            Instead, they aim to solve these problems and make buying glasses easy, fun, pleasing, and
                            inexpensive.

                            Both statements also mention Warby Parkers dedication to providing glasses to people in need
                            around the world.</p>

                                Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did
                                something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw
                                something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
